## Employee Management System


***Employee Management System*** is a CMS tool, used to generate ID's and employee profiles at different roles & ranks.

  

  ***Brief Functional Overview***

Employee Management System allows users in the management capacity to generate new profiles off of the command line. It will:
 * Create personalized profile information based off of what the user has submitted

 * The user will then have this information generated & appended into a card on the HTML 
 document

 * The card will follow in accordance with the employee role / rank

You can see here that we have built a command-line application that allows the user to:

  * Add roles, employees
